Hello! I’m Eduard Stefanescu, from Romania, an enthusiast programmer that likes to work with backend frameworks, but also enjoys to work with new web-application frameworks. From time to time I want to learn new ones, that I will also blog about.

Currently, I’m working at Nagarro (former iQuest), as a software engineer. My interest topics are focused in the following directions:

- Backend: .NET, Java, Python
- Frontend: AngularJS, Angular, React
- Mobile development
- Electronics: building things with Arduino

You may notice that I also specified some frameworks, I like to think that I’m an agnostic programmer, that can craft a solution from anything at hand based on the requirements. For me, it’s much more important the logic behind, clean code and how the entire architecture looks like, rather than the framework used.
